# Clearest Framework (WIP)
This is another front-end development framework for NodeJS.
Despite of being created recently, the project already had a couple of years of mileage in highly complex projects.

Its previous versions were closed-source and based on a combination of XSLT with other custom-built tools. Today it is being re-implemented to stay within NodeJS ecosystem. 

The WIP is going towards its first open-source release of v2.0. Hopefully, one may find in it an alternative to other MVC front-end frameworks like AngularJS and RecatJS. 

Features:
* Designed for development of modular MVC/MVVM apps with minimal coding effort;
* Provides high-level, abstract, XML-based language for component development;
* Almost everything is done with a dozen of XML tags around your code;
* Compliable into reusable JavaScript modules (no parsing at runtime);
* No struggle with custom components or existing libs - it'll work with just anything you can require("...") and browsetify;
* Small-footprint runtime library of essentials (only depends on Q), other convinient features like hash navigation and REST resources are only used as require()'ed;
* Ready to merge into your gulp workflow out of the box;

More code and docs are coming soon.
